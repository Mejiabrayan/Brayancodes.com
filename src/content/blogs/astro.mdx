Recently, I found myself digging through Contentful's documentation, spending too much time setting up proper formatting like syntax highlighting for my personal website. The inconvenience of navigating documentation just to achieve simple tasks like displaying code blocks can be a pain point. Most of the time, third-party libraries are required, which are quicker to set up but not the ideal route. When you factor in styling and other considerations, it can get complicated. Maybe it's a skill issue, but it would be preferable if functionality existed in frameworks natively.
